# random-team-gen

The main purpose of this project was to help improve my skills with vanilla javascript which I hoped would then further improve my skills with JS frameworks such as React.js.
The idea behind the project came from playing team games with friends. We would always struggle to organise each other into teams at random, then I thought it would be great to have a site with a basic UI that could randomise a list of names into a selected amount of teams. So thats what I done with this, the user can enter as many names as they please then select the amount of teams needed then hit randomise, an algorithm will then completly randomise the list and put each person from the list into a team and display it.
